# Spam Filter Project

## Introduction

This project implements a machine learning-based spam filter using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It leverages Python libraries such as `nltk`, `gensim`, and `scikit-learn` to classify messages as spam or not spam. The project includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training using various algorithms such as Naive Bayes.

## Features

- Text preprocessing including tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- Feature extraction using both Count Vectorizer.
- Model training with Naive Bayes classifiers (MultinomialNB and ComplementNB).
- Visualization of confusion matrix, ROC curve, and precision-recall curve.
- Option to extend the analysis using topic modeling with `gensim` and visualizations with `pyLDAvis`.

## Conclusions
In this NLP project a Naive Bayes Classificator was implemented in order to filter SPAM mails; It showed excellent performances on Test Set achieving an accuracy of 0.96 and a F1-score of 0.96. Moreover, SPAM mails were divided into 9 groups using Topic Modelling techniques.
